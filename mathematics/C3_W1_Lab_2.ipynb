You have a classroom full of students (the number may vary) and want to know the probabilities of two students having the same birthday or of any student having a particular birthday, anything along those lines. As mentioned before, you will see 4 variations of the problem.\n",

    "You can think of these problems in two ways:\n",
    "   - What is the minimum number of students `n` that need to be in the classroom to have a matching birthday with a given probability?\n",
    "   - Given `n` what is the probability of having a match?\n",

    "Both ways model the situation from different angles but they are essentially covering the same.\n",

    "## Play the game of matching your birthday\n",

    "To further motivate this situation a game is presented. You can use the following cell to run an interactive game, it is very simple to use: you need to select your birthday (the year does not matter) in the dropdown widget and then you can click the `Simulate!` button to randomly create students until one of them has the same birthday as you. The left plot shows you the history of the result for each simulation and the right plot shows you the same information in a histogram so you can see how this variable distributes.\n",
