    "In this assignment you will solve a simple optimization problem for a function of one variable. Given a dataset of historical prices of a product from two suppliers, your task is to identify what share of the product you should buy from each of the suppliers to make the best possible investment in the future. Stating the problem mathematically, you will construct a target function to minimize, evaluate its minimum and investigate how its derivative is connected with the result."

For the Budget model you can set some percentage of the goods to be purchased from supplier A (e.g. 60%) and the remaining part from supplier B (e.g. 40%), but this split should be kept consistent for the whole of the twelve months period.
