I love cooking.\\n\\nBut while I cook, suddenly the same dream happens again and again, and I wake up in different beds, in different apartments, in different homes, with different memories, with different jobs, and with different families too.\\n\\nI get out and look around. I'm in my living room. It's small, but it has a television and a couch. There is a table in the corner, and on it sits a picture of a family. A woman and a manâ€”a mother and father, and a young son.\\n\\nI look at the picture, and it seems as if I were there the entire time, sitting at the very table, watching and dreaming.\\n\\nAnd then it starts again, in the exact same place, but this time with a girl and a woman.

I'll get out of bed and walk into the bathroom. I open the door, and my hand will go right into the mirror, where I'll find a little glass vial sitting there.

Because I'm only at [this] age, where I finally start to understand the importance of communication in esports. Because there is something that goes by my ear on esports that we're never exposed toâ€”that in order for that to happen, we've gotta learn to move beyond talking and focusing on what's happening in the world. Because there's an argument in esports that just because you put your hand between your teeth right now and the microphone or the mic doesn't mean it came from the right, and that's not happening in esports today. So no matter what the situation, there's gonna be dramaâ€”I just can't imagine that happening in a game like Dota 2 because we're just playingâ€”anyone that's been around a long time knows where we're supposed to go from here. That's the truth of it, you can either be excited or disappointed and that's what my goal is to do [with the project]. But to do it right, I want everyone to be comfortable who we are, and let a person be, so that, for me, is a positive thing for our future. I could even do it in an esports format, but I can't put something on that's what the public think of.\\\"\\n\\nIn the end, though, if you're going to be a champion in a scene that's bigger than Overwatch, why not put your best arm between your teeth and help get it going in Overwatch?\\n\\nToward that end, I think that the best thing I could do is to help people who are not super skilled because that's not gonna be something that they would even consider. I hope [my friend] Daniel, who runs [Team SoloMid], who's really kind of a champion in terms of his attitude and his personalityâ€¦it's something the media would really want to cover, and hopefully I will be helping those people.\\n\\nSo the more time you dedicate to esports, the less it'll take you to say something before people know what's good and what's not.\\n\\nWe really wanted to make a statement that at the end of the day we feel like it's for both us and our teammates, because of how passionate we can be about the game,\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"num_tokens\": null,\n    \"num_input_tokens\": null\n}"
