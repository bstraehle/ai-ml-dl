GPT-4 is a Transformer- based model pre-trained to\\npredict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment\\nprocess results in improved performance on measures of factuality and\\nadherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was\\ndeveloping infrastructure and optimization methods that behave\\npredictably across a wide range of scales.

We find that\\nimproved capabilities, whilst usually measured in English, can be\\ndemonstrated in many different languages. We highlight how predictable\\nscaling allowed us to make accurate predictions on the loss and\\ncapabilities of GPT-4.\\nGPT-4 presents new risks due to increased capability, and we discuss\\nsome of the methods and results taken to understand and improve its\\nsafety and alignment.

The model was then fine-tuned\\nusing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [40].

There's no surprise here, given that some of these documents are long and convoluted on purpose (did you know that reading through all your privacy policies would take almost a quarter of a year?). Aside from inefficiency, workers may simply refrain from reading some documents (for example, Only 16% of Employees Read Their Employment Contracts Entirely Before Signing!).

In today's information overload age, nearly 30% of the workday is spent dealing with documents. There's no surprise here, given that some of these documents are long and convoluted on purpose (did you know that reading through all your privacy policies would take almost a quarter of a year?). Aside from inefficiency, workers may simply refrain from reading some documents (for example, Only 16% of Employees Read Their Employment Contracts Entirely Before Signing!). \\n\\nThis is where AI-driven summarization tools can be helpful: instead of reading entire documents, which is tedious and time-consuming, users can (ideally) quickly extract relevant information from a text. With large language models, the development of those tools is easier than ever, and you can offer your users a summary that is specifically tailored to their preferences.\",\n            \"segmentType\": \"normal_text\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"segmentText\": \"Let's take legal documents, for example.

Taxpayer represents the facts as follows.\\nFACTS\\nTaxpayer was incorporated as a State nonprofit corporation. Taxpayer is exempt from federal income tax under IRC section 501(a) as an organization described in IRC section 501(c)(3) and is classified as a private foundation under IRC section 509(a). Taxpayer was created by Individuals to support the domestic and international Community and various charitable organizations. Individuals were substantial contributors to Taxpayer within the meaning of IRC section 507(d)(2), and therefore disqualified persons with respect to Taxpayer under IRC section 4946(a)(1)(A).\\nAs a result of Individuals’ death, Taxpayer received A shares of Entity 1 common voting stock from Trust, a disqualified person, on Date 1, which Taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. Additionally, on Date 2, Granddaughter, who is the granddaughter of one of the Individuals, and who serves as a co-trustee of Taxpayer, received a testamentary disposition from Trust of B shares of Entity 1 common voting stock. Granddaughter is also a disqualified person under IRC section 4946. The combined shares of Taxpayer and Granddaughter represent approximately C percent of Entity 1’s outstanding capital stock and are a minority interest in Entity 1. As a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the A shares, Taxpayer has excess business holdings of Entity 1 under IRC section 4943(c)(1).\\nOn Date 3, also as a result of Individuals’ death, Taxpayer received from Trust an approximate Z percent membership interest in Entity 2, an LLC, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. As a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the LLC membership interest, which is a minority interest, Taxpayer has excess business holdings of Entity 2 under IRC section 4943(c)(1).\\nSummary:\\n- A taxpayer requested an extension of five years under IRC section 4943(c)(7) for disposing of certain excess business holdings.\\n- A testamentary gift of stock to Taxpayer and a testamentary disposition to Granddaughter, both disqualified persons, resulted in Taxpayer having excess business holdings of Entity 1 under IRC section 4943(c)(1).\\n- On Date 3, Taxpayer received an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest of an LLC membership interest, which is an excess business holding.\\n##\\nYou will now be presented with a part of a legal letter.
