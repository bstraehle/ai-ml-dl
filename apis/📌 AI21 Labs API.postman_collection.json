Taxpayer represents the facts as follows.\\nFACTS\\nTaxpayer was incorporated as a State nonprofit corporation. Taxpayer is exempt from federal income tax under IRC section 501(a) as an organization described in IRC section 501(c)(3) and is classified as a private foundation under IRC section 509(a). Taxpayer was created by Individuals to support the domestic and international Community and various charitable organizations. Individuals were substantial contributors to Taxpayer within the meaning of IRC section 507(d)(2), and therefore disqualified persons with respect to Taxpayer under IRC section 4946(a)(1)(A).\\nAs a result of Individuals’ death, Taxpayer received A shares of Entity 1 common voting stock from Trust, a disqualified person, on Date 1, which Taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. Additionally, on Date 2, Granddaughter, who is the granddaughter of one of the Individuals, and who serves as a co-trustee of Taxpayer, received a testamentary disposition from Trust of B shares of Entity 1 common voting stock. Granddaughter is also a disqualified person under IRC section 4946. The combined shares of Taxpayer and Granddaughter represent approximately C percent of Entity 1’s outstanding capital stock and are a minority interest in Entity 1. As a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the A shares, Taxpayer has excess business holdings of Entity 1 under IRC section 4943(c)(1).\\nOn Date 3, also as a result of Individuals’ death, Taxpayer received from Trust an approximate Z percent membership interest in Entity 2, an LLC, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. As a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the LLC membership interest, which is a minority interest, Taxpayer has excess business holdings of Entity 2 under IRC section 4943(c)(1).\\nSummary:\\n- A taxpayer requested an extension of five years under IRC section 4943(c)(7) for disposing of certain excess business holdings.\\n- A testamentary gift of stock to Taxpayer and a testamentary disposition to Granddaughter, both disqualified persons, resulted in Taxpayer having excess business holdings of Entity 1 under IRC section 4943(c)(1).\\n- On Date 3, Taxpayer received an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest of an LLC membership interest, which is an excess business holding.\\n##\\nYou will now be presented with a part of a legal letter.

Aside from inefficiency, workers may simply refrain from reading some documents (for example, Only 16% of Employees Read Their Employment Contracts Entirely Before Signing!).   This is where AI-driven summarization tools can be helpful: instead of reading entire documents, which is tedious and time-consuming, users can (ideally) quickly extract relevant information from a text. With large language models, the development of those tools is easier than ever, and you can offer your users a summary that is specifically tailored to their preferences.  Let's take legal documents, for example. Though they are written in English, many people find legal documents to be difficult to comprehend, as if they were actually written in a foreign language. Moreover, the interesting parts of each document may differ depending on the person who reads it, so off-the-shelf summarization tools may be too general or too specific.

Users can specify their preferences, and the tool will generate a summary that is specifically tailored to their needs.\\n• Legal Documents: Legal documents, especially those written in English, can be difficult to comprehend due to their complex language. AI-driven summarization tools can help users understand complex legal concepts by providing concise and understandable summaries.\\n• Different Perspectives: The interesting parts of a document may differ depending on who is reading it.
