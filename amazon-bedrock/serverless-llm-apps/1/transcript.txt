spk_0: Certainly. My full name is Alexander Thompson. My contact number is 12345678910. And the credit card is, wait, did you say pre authorization? How much would that be? 
spk_1: Ah, I should have mentioned that earlier. My apologies. A pre authorization amount of '$1000' will be held on your card which would be released upon checkout. 
spk_0: '$1000'. That seems a bit excessive. Don't you think 
spk_1: I understand your concern, Alex. The pre authorization is a standard procedure to cover any incidental expenses you may incur during your stay. However, I assure you its only a hold and not an actual charge. 
spk_0: Thats still a lot. Are there any additional charges that I should know about? 
spk_1: Well, there is a 10% service charge and a 7% fantasy tax applied to the room rate. 
spk_0: Mm. You know what its a special occasion. So lets go ahead. 
spk_1: Thank you, Alex for understanding. Will ensure that your experience at Crystal Heights is well worth it.
