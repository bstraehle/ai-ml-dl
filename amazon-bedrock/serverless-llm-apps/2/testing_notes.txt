# Testing note to set up CFN:

# Create a bucket to be used in this lessons.  Reuse the bucket in future lessons.
# Note the bucket name must be globally unique!

#!aws s3api create-bucket --bucket dlai-bucket-test-87gadiubasdiuh

# Add the name of the bucket here               |

# ToDo: Add CLI line to copy the mp3 to the bucket....

# Tech Note: DLAI will need to get output (bucket name) from CFN Stack 
# and make available to the environment var. ToDo: Mike provide a CLI script 
# to get name of the bucket from the stack. 

# Tech Note: Will also need to upload the mp3 into the bucket (in the CFN or maybe in script).
