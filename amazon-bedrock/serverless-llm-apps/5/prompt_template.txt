I need to summarize a conversation. The transcript of the conversation is between the <data> XML like tags.

<data>
{{transcript}}
</data>

The summary must contain a one word sentiment analysis, and a list of issues, problems or causes of friction
during the conversation. The output must be provided in JSON format shown in the following example. 

Example output:
{
    "version": 0.1,
    "sentiment": <sentiment>,
    "issues": [
        {
            "topic": <topic>,
            "summary": <issue_summary>,
        }
    ]
}

An `issue_summary` must only be one of:
{%- for topic in topics %}
 - `{{topic}}`
{% endfor %}

Write the JSON output and nothing more.

Here is the JSON output:
