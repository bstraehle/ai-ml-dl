The reward model is trained in advance to the policy being optimized to predict if a given output is good (high reward) or bad (low reward). RLHF can improve the robustness and exploration of RL agents, especially when the reward function is sparse or noisy.Human feedback is collected by asking humans to rank instances of the agent's behavior. These rankings can then be used to score outputs, for example with the Elo rating system."}

When it is said that \u201cthe model accuracy is 90%\u201d it might not be uniform across subgroups of data and there might be some input conditions which the model fails more. So, it is the next step from aggregate metrics to a more in-depth review of model errors for improvement."}
